## About

This is my vim configuration, based on [Vundle] package manager
![vimrc-screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2725779/vim.png)

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/kravitz/.vim.git ~/.vim
    $ git submodule init
    $ ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Then it would be good to install patched font. I prefer
Anonymous Pro, which you can get by
    
    $ wget https://gist.github.com/gists/2418116/download
